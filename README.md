# .NET Application Deployment on AWS
## Three Architecture Patterns: Traditional, Modern, and Serverless

This repository contains a comprehensive lab series demonstrating three different AWS deployment architectures for the same .NET application. You'll learn how to deploy a real-world application using traditional EC2 instances, modern containerization, and cutting-edge serverless technologies.

## The Application: Lecture Summarizer

### Overview

The **Lecture Summarizer** is a practical .NET application that demonstrates AI integration with AWS cloud services. It accepts PDF lecture uploads and generates intelligent summaries using AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet).

### Architecture Components

**Backend Technologies:**
- **.NET 9 Web API** - RESTful API for PDF processing and AI integration
- **AWS Bedrock** - AI-powered visual analysis using Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2
- **Docnet.Core** - PDF to image conversion library for visual processing
- **CORS Configuration** - Cross-origin support for frontend communication

**Frontend Options:**
- **ASP.NET Core MVC (Razor)** - Server-side rendering for traditional deployments
- **Blazor WebAssembly** - Client-side SPA for modern/serverless deployments

**Key Features:**
- 📄 **PDF Upload** - Accepts lecture documents in PDF format
- 🖼️ **Visual AI Analysis** - Converts PDF pages to images for comprehensive visual analysis
- 🤖 **AI Summarization** - Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 to analyze diagrams, charts, and formatted content
- 🎨 **Responsive UI** - Clean, Bootstrap-styled interface
- 🔒 **Secure Processing** - Proper error handling and validation
- 📊 **Health Monitoring** - Built-in health check endpoints

### Frontend/Backend Architecture Flexibility

**🔄 Mix and Match Capability**: This application demonstrates **separation of concerns** between frontend and backend, allowing you to deploy different combinations across the labs:

**Backend Options:**
- **EC2 API** (Lab 1) - Traditional server deployment
- **ECS Container** (Lab 2) - Containerized API
- **Lambda Function** (Lab 3) - Serverless API

**Frontend Options:**
- **Razor MVC on EC2** (Lab 1) - Server-side rendering
- **Blazor SPA on S3** (Labs 2 & 3) - Client-side application
                                                                                                                            
**Possible Combinations:**
```
Frontend              Backend              Use Case
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Razor MVC (EC2)    ←→ API (EC2)          Traditional monolithic
Razor MVC (EC2)    ←→ API (ECS)          Hybrid: traditional UI + modern backend
Blazor SPA (S3)    ←→ API (EC2)          Modern UI + traditional backend  
Blazor SPA (S3)    ←→ API (ECS)          Full modern architecture
Blazor SPA (S3)    ←→ API (Lambda)       Full serverless architecture
```

**🎯 Learning Value**: This flexibility teaches you how **microservices** and **API-first design** enable architectural choices based on specific requirements like cost, scale, and team expertise.

## Lab Series Overview

This lab series teaches three fundamental cloud deployment patterns by deploying the same application using different AWS architectures. Each lab builds upon cloud computing concepts while demonstrating distinct approaches to scalability, cost optimization, and operational complexity.

### Lab 1: EC2 Split Deployment - Traditional Infrastructure 🖥️

**Architecture Pattern**: Traditional server-based deployment with service separation

```
Internet → ALB (Frontend) → EC2 (Razor MVC)
        ↓
       ALB (Backend) → EC2 (.NET API) → AWS Bedrock
```

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- **Infrastructure Fundamentals** - VPC, Security Groups, IAM roles
- **Service Separation** - Independent frontend and backend instances
- **Load Balancing** - Application Load Balancer configuration
- **Production Deployment** - Systemd services and monitoring

**When to Use:**
- Legacy applications requiring specific OS configurations
- Applications needing persistent local storage
- Environments requiring full server control
- Traditional enterprise environments

### Lab 2: ECS + S3 Deployment - Modern Containerization 🐳

**Architecture Pattern**: Containerized backend with static frontend hosting

```
Internet → CloudFront → S3 (Blazor SPA)
        ↓
       ALB → ECS Fargate (API Container) → AWS Bedrock
```

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- **Container Orchestration** - ECS Fargate for serverless containers
- **Static Site Hosting** - S3 + CloudFront for global performance
- **Modern CI/CD** - Docker builds and ECR registry
- **Scalable Architecture** - Auto-scaling containers and CDN

**When to Use:**
- Microservices architectures
- Applications with predictable traffic patterns
- Teams adopting containerization
- Modern web applications requiring global reach

### Lab 3: Lambda + S3 Deployment - Serverless Computing ⚡

**Architecture Pattern**: Fully serverless with Infrastructure as Code

```
Internet → CloudFront → S3 (Blazor SPA)
        ↓
       API Gateway → Lambda (.NET) → AWS Bedrock
```

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- **Serverless Computing** - AWS Lambda with .NET Native AOT
- **Infrastructure as Code** - AWS SAM templates and CloudFormation
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - API Gateway integration
- **Cost Optimization** - Pay-per-request pricing model

**When to Use:**
- Variable or unpredictable traffic
- Cost-sensitive applications
- Event-driven workloads
- Startups and rapid prototyping

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account** with appropriate permissions
- **.NET 8 SDK** installed locally
- **Docker Desktop** (for Labs 2 & 3)
- **AWS CLI** configured
- **AWS SAM CLI** (for Lab 3)
- **Git** for version control

### Local Development and Testing

Before deploying to AWS, you can run and test the application locally. This requires AWS credentials for Bedrock AI integration.

#### AWS Credentials for Local Development

1. **Create IAM User for Local Development**:
   - Go to **IAM Console** → **Users** → **Create user**
   - **User name**: `lecture-local-developer`
   - **Attach policies directly**:
     - `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` (for AI functionality)
     - `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess` (for logging)

2. **Create Access Keys**:
   - Select your user → **Security credentials** tab
   - **Create access key** → **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
   - **Save credentials** securely

3. **Configure AWS CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Configure AWS credentials
   aws configure
   
   # Enter your values:
   # AWS Access Key ID: [Your Access Key ID]
   # AWS Secret Access Key: [Your Secret Access Key]
   # Default region name: us-east-1
   # Default output format: json
   
   # Verify configuration
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```

#### Running the Application Locally

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd LectureSummarizer
   ```

2. **Test Backend API**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to API project
   cd LectureSummarizer.API
   
   # Run the API
   dotnet run
   
   # Test health endpoint in another terminal
   curl http://localhost:5131/health
   
   # API will be available at http://localhost:5131
   ```

3. **Test Razor Frontend**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to Web project (new terminal)
   cd LectureSummarizer.Web
   
   # Run the web application
   dotnet run
   
   # Web app will be available at http://localhost:5235
   ```

4. **Test Blazor SPA Frontend**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to SPA project (new terminal)
   cd LectureSummarizer.Web.SPA
   
   # Run the SPA
   dotnet run
   
   # SPA will be available at http://localhost:5252
   ```

5. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Visit either frontend URL
   - Upload a sample PDF lecture file
   - Verify AI summarization works with AWS Bedrock

⚠️ **Note**: The same AWS credentials created for local testing can be reused for Lab deployments, though you may need additional permissions for specific AWS services (ECS, Lambda, etc.).

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd LectureSummarizer
   ```

2. **Choose your learning path**:
   - **Sequential Learning**: Start with Lab 1 → Lab 2 → Lab 3
   - **Specific Interest**: Jump to any lab based on your architecture preference
   - **Comparison Study**: Deploy all three to compare approaches

3. **Setup AWS credentials** (detailed in each lab)

4. **Follow the lab guides**:
   - [Lab 1: EC2 Split Deployment](lab1-ec2-deployment.md)
   - [Lab 2: ECS + S3 Deployment](lab2-ecs-s3-deployment.md)
   - [Lab 3: Lambda + S3 Deployment](lab3-lambda-s3-deployment.md)
